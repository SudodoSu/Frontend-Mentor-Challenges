## Interactive Rating Component - FrontendMentor Challenge

This project is an interactive rating component inspired by a challenge on FrontendMentor. The goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing rating system that allows users to provide their feedback through a range of ratings. The component will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive design that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### Key Features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The rating component will feature a clear and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to understand and interact with.
- **Interactive Rating Selection:** Users will be able to select their desired rating by clicking or tapping on the appropriate star. The selected rating will be visually highlighted, providing instant feedback to the user.
- **Hover Effects:** When users hover over the stars, the component will provide interactive visual effects, such as changing the color or size of the stars, giving users a visual cue of their interaction.
- **Accessibility Considerations:** The rating component will be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring it meets web accessibility standards. It will be compatible with assistive technologies, providing an inclusive user experience for all users.
- **Customization Options:** The component will offer customization options, allowing developers to easily modify the appearance, size, and color scheme to match the overall design of their web application.

By creating this interactive rating component, we aim to enhance user engagement and provide a seamless way for users to express their opinions and ratings. Whether it's for a product review system, feedback form, or any other application that requires user ratings, this component will serve as a versatile and visually appealing solution.
